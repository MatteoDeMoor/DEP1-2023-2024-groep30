## Project Description

This project explores the feasibility of achieving long-term profitability in sports betting through advanced data analysis, with a focus on the Belgian Jupiler Pro League. The primary objective is to determine whether systematic betting strategies—such as consistently betting on the underdog or betting based on specific conditions—can yield sustainable profits over time.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathering historical and real-time match data, standings, goals, and betting odds via web scraping.  
   - Sources include Transfermarkt, Bet777, and other sports/betting sites.  
   - Python (BeautifulSoup) is used for data extraction.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Ensuring data quality by removing duplicates and resolving inconsistencies.  
   - Standardizing data from multiple sources into uniform formats.

3. **Data Storage (DWH)**  
   - Designing and implementing a data warehouse in Microsoft SQL Server.  
   - Storing both historical match data and betting odds in fact and dimension tables for efficient querying.

4. **Data Analysis**  
   - Using SQL and Python (pandas) to explore and analyze data.  
   - Simulating various betting scenarios to assess potential profitability.  
   - Identifying trends and patterns to inform long-term betting strategies.

5. **Visualization**  
   - Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI.  
   - Demonstrating insights on match outcomes, odds variations, and betting performance.
